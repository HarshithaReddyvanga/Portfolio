<h5>My Cybersecurity Portfolio</h5>
<h6> 
        The dynamic field of cybersecurity naturally draws me in as a passionate lifelong student who adheres to laws and regulations. This field's constant evolution not only fits with my enthusiasm but also offers opportunities for further professional and personal development. The knowledge that I help protect the very company that has given me this chance gives me great happiness.

  I actively pursued my interest in cybersecurity throughout my Bachelor of Science and Engineering program by attending conferences on ethical hacking, workshops, and taking on positions on the organizing committees of prominent national social service programs. Despite my intense enthusiasm, my lack of real-world experience made it difficult for me to enter into the cybersecurity industry. However, I was able to obtain jobs in four different organizations during my on-campus placements.

  Tata Consultancy Services was notable among them all for its steadfast adherence to morals and principles. After undergoing intensive training, I was given a project on SAP Security for Tata Motors and, within six months, I was awarded a "On the Spot Award". Through the use of automation, teamwork, and senior leadership, I was able to successfully minimize user provisioning efforts by an astounding 74%. Later, for personal reasons, I moved to Ericsson IT, where I worked on vulnerability management using Virtual Forge and was recognized with a "Special Achievement Award" for my effective handling of upgrades and implementations.

  I moved to Infosys because I was ready for new challenges and since Onapsis had acquired Virtual Forge. There, I concentrated on vulnerability management using Splunk Enterprise, a SIEM tool, and Onapsis. I enrolled in the University of Central Missouri's Master of Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program because I wanted to go beyond the conventional approaches to SAP security.

  I worked on practical cybersecurity projects like IP Spoofing attacks, Metasploitable framework, Nessus Vulnerabilities Scanning, Threat Modeling, and Computer Forensics during my academic career. Working at the college front desk allowed me to build excellent relationships with coworkers, managers, and other students as part of my commitment to networking.

 Currently, I hold a Certification in Cybersecurity from (ISC)Â², and I am actively working towards completing the CompTIA Security+ Certificate to further validate my abilities. I am now seeking a role that not only aligns with my expertise but also promotes ongoing professional growth and development."

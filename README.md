<h5>My Cybersecurity Portfolio</h5>
<h6> 
  Being a continous learner with strict adherence to laws and regulations, I always find Cybersecurity as my interest as it is ever changing and promotes continous growth with the satisfaction that we are protecting the organization that gave us the opportunity.

  During my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering , I have attended workshops and conferences on Cybersecurity and Ethical hacking along with Leading National Social Service(NSS) Organizing committee and participating in Paper presentations across the colleges in my state. Even though, it interests me I didn’t find a breakthrough to that field due to lack of Experience in that field. During my on campus placements I got into 4 Organizations.

  Out of All, based on ethics and values Tata Consultancy Services Stood out and I have joined the organization and they have given me a project on SAP Security for client Tata Motors after 40 days of training and with in 6 Months I was able to get "On the Spot Award" by collaborating with team members , seniors and also other team members as I had automated the user provisioning tasks which reduced efforts by 74% . Later due to personal issues , I changed to my home location and Joined project Ericsson IT , where I had done upgrades and implementations with less span and my manager awarded me with "Special Achievement Award" and given chance to work on Vulnerability Management using Virtual Forge

  With Virtual Forge being acquired by Onapsis, and also I am ready for new challenges , I switched to Infosys where I had done Vulnerability management using Onapsis and SIEM tool Splunk Enterprise and also POC for implementations . At this stage I felt I shouldn’t restrict to traditional approches of SAP Security and Cybersecurity. I wanted to protect the Entire system means to reduce attack surface wherever possible.

  That thought led me to take Masters in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance from University of Central Missouri. Along with performing hands-on cybersecurity tasks like IP Spoofing attacks, Metasploitable framework , Nessus Vulnerabilities Scanning , Threat Modeling , Computer Forensics and much more , I build a strong relation with my fellow students , workers and my supervisors by working at College Front desk as I felt that is the best way to network with people.

  Now, I have cleared Certification in Cybersecurity from (ISC)2 and in progress of completing CompITA Security+ Certificate to prove my abilities and get a job where it promotes professional growth.

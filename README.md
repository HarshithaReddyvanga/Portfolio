<h5>My Cybersecurity Portfolio</h5>
<h6> 
        As a fervent and continual learner with a steadfast commitment to laws and regulations, I am inherently drawn to the dynamic realm of cybersecurity. The ever-evolving nature of this field not only aligns with my passion but also promises continuous personal and professional growth. I find immense satisfaction in the knowledge that I contribute to safeguarding the very organization that has entrusted me with the opportunity.

Throughout my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering, I actively pursued my interest in cybersecurity by participating in workshops, conferences on ethical hacking, and assuming roles in the organizing committee of leading national social service initiatives. Despite my ardent interest, I faced challenges breaking into the cybersecurity field due to a lack of practical experience. Nevertheless, during on-campus placements, I secured positions in four organizations.

Among these, Tata Consultancy Services stood out for its unwavering commitment to ethics and values. Assigned to a project on SAP Security for Tata Motors after extensive training, I received an "On the Spot Award" within six months. Collaborating with team members, seniors, and leveraging automation, I successfully reduced user provisioning efforts by an impressive 74%. Subsequently, due to personal reasons, I transitioned to Ericsson IT, where I earned a "Special Achievement Award" for efficiently handling upgrades and implementations, and I contributed to Vulnerability Management using Virtual Forge.

With the acquisition of Virtual Forge by Onapsis and a readiness for new challenges, I moved to Infosys, where I focused on Vulnerability Management using Onapsis and the SIEM tool Splunk Enterprise. My desire to expand beyond traditional SAP Security approaches led me to pursue a Master's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance from the University of Central Missouri.

During my academic journey, I engaged in hands-on cybersecurity tasks such as IP Spoofing attacks, Metasploitable framework, Nessus Vulnerabilities Scanning, Threat Modeling, and Computer Forensics. My commitment to networking extended to working at the college front desk, fostering strong relationships with fellow students, colleagues, and supervisors.

Currently, I hold a Certification in Cybersecurity from (ISC)Â², and I am actively working towards completing the CompTIA Security+ Certificate to further validate my abilities. I am now seeking a role that not only aligns with my expertise but also promotes ongoing professional growth and development
